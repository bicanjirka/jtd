# Known gaps and future work

Extracted from inline `TODO` comments (and one unmarked-but-real gap) found throughout the codebase during a
documentation cleanup pass. Each item below replaces the original comment; the source no longer carries these notes, so
this file is the single place to look for outstanding design/feature gaps.

## Gameplay / balance

### Zero-price wave penalty is a placeholder

When an enemy whose `price` is `0` reaches the end of the path, `AbstractEnemyMob.doTick()` docks a flat 10 points from
the score instead of the enemy's price (since 0 would dock nothing). That `10` was never a designed value — just a
stand-in.

- **Where:** `AbstractEnemyMob.doTick()`
- **Approach:** either give price-0 "filler" enemies (see `EnemyFactory.Enemy.Empty`) an explicit configurable penalty,
  or decide that reaching the end with a price-0 enemy shouldn't penalize the player at all and drop the branch.

### Ghost health doesn't scale with level

`EnemyMobGhost.doInit()` always divides incoming health by a flat `5`, unlike its body size (`bodyScale`), which already
scales with `level`. Health reduction should probably scale the same way so ghosts stay balanced at higher levels.

- **Where:** `EnemyMobGhost.doInit()`
- **Approach:** replace the flat `/5` with a level-scaled divisor, mirroring the `(this.level < 6) ? (7 - level) : (2)`
  pattern already used for `bodyScale` in the same method (or a deliberately different curve, if `5` was chosen for a
  reason that's no longer documented — worth play-testing either way).

## Movement / pathing

### Wave-entry spawn delay is a hardcoded constant

`AbstractEnemyMob.doInit()` converts an enemy's `delay` (its position within a wave) to tick-count via
`Math.round(22.4f * delay / this.speed)`. The `22.4f` is a magic constant with no way to override it per-wave.

- **Where:** `AbstractEnemyMob.doInit()`
- **Approach:** add a `delay`-scaling field to `WaveDefinition` (or `Wave`) that defaults to `22.4f`, and extend the wave
  mini-language (see `WaveScript.parse`'s `c`/`e`/`t`/... token grammar) with a token — e.g. a `w<number>` prefix — that
  lets a wave definition override the spacing between spawns before listing enemies.

## Levels

### Only a Java-code level catalog exists

`LevelCatalog` is the abstraction levels are meant to be sourced through, but `BuiltInLevelCatalog` (levels defined as
Java code, e.g. `LevelDefinition` constants built from a hand-authored `List<Point>` of corners) is the only
implementation. There is no way to add or edit a level without a code change and a rebuild.

- **Where:** `td.level.LevelCatalog`, `td.level.BuiltInLevelCatalog`
- **Approach:** add a `FileLevelCatalog implements LevelCatalog` that parses level files (format TBD — JSON is the
  obvious choice given `LevelDefinition`'s shape) from a resources or config directory into `LevelDefinition`s. A
  malformed level file should throw `td.util.GameStartupException`, which `Main` already catches as the one
  fatal-startup boundary, rather than adding a second error-handling path.

## Tower features

### Tower upgrade doesn't gate on affordability

`PanelTowerInfo.moneyChanged()` currently just refreshes the displayed tower status text/price when money changes;
there's no logic checking or indicating whether the player can afford to upgrade the currently-selected tower (the
original comment on this method said it was "not used yet — here for future upgrade-affordability checks", but that
check was never implemented, and there's no "upgrade" action to gate in the first place).

- **Where:** `PanelTowerInfo.moneyChanged()`
- **Approach:** this depends on a real upgrade-purchase flow existing first (currently the only "upgrade" mechanic is
  placing a separate `TowerAura` tower nearby, not upgrading an existing tower in place) — worth deciding whether
  in-place tower upgrades are even a wanted feature before building the affordability check.

### Rotating tower sprites

Towers don't rotate their sprite image to visually face their current target (enemy mobs already do this via
`AbstractEnemyMobDirectional`/`AbstractEnemyMobRotor`). This was a speculative "nice to have," not a committed design.

- **Where:** `td.ui.TowerSpriteFrameBuilder`, `td.ui.render.TowerSpriteDraw`
- **Approach:** if pursued, reuse the facing-angle approach already implemented for directional/rotor enemies
  (`AbstractEnemyMobRotor.getFacingRadians()`/`AbstractEnemyMobDirectional.getFacingRadians()`); needs per-tower
  "facing" state updated whenever a tower picks a new target (`TowerOne.findEnemy()`, `TowerTwo`'s find methods,
  etc.) and exposed as a getter, then threaded through as a new `facingRadians` field on `TowerSpriteDraw` (currently
  unused by towers - `EnemyBodyDraw`/`EnemyFadeDraw` already carry one) and applied as a rotation in
  `Java2DFrameRenderer.paintTowerSprite()` alongside rotated sprite art for each tower.
